## About Mossland Digital Twin Research

At Mossland, we are committed to extending the boundaries of the metaverse into the tangible world by leveraging Digital Twin technology. Our vision is to create precise digital replicas of real-world environments, enabling seamless integration and interaction between virtual and physical realities. Through innovative research and practical applications, we aim to enhance operational efficiency, sustainability, and connectivity across various industries, ultimately contributing to smarter, more responsive, and resilient urban and industrial ecosystems.

### Current Phase

While Digital Twin technology can be applied broadly, our current research phase focuses specifically on building Digital Twin Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs). We are assessing the capabilities and limitations of available tools, identifying potential challenges, and exploring directions for improvement and future enhancements.

### Next Steps

* Creation of a Digital Twin for an actual building
* Simulation and control integration within the Digital Twin framework
